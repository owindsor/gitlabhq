    <p>To control permissons against a branch, the workflow is a little weird. First, you need to commit back to the repo so that you have atleast one branch Next, open the project from the project view by clicking on the project name</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the 'Commits' tab</li>
      <li>Then select the 'Branches' sub-tab</li>
      <li>Select the 'Protected' sub-tab</li>
      <li>Select that branch that you want to protect and click'Add'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The selected branch will now be only writable by users with a 'Master' permission on that project.</p>
