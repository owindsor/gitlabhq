<h3>Git Cheat Sheet</h3>

<h4>Setup</h4>

<p>git clone [repo]</p>

<p>clone the repository specified by ; this is similar to
"checkout" in some other version control systems such as
Subversion and CVS</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>git config -e [--global]</p>

<p>edit the .git/config [or ~/.gitconfig] file in your
$EDITOR</p>

<div class='bash'>
<pre>
 
    git config --global user.name 'John Doe'  
    git config --global user.emailjohndoe@example.com
</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>git config branch.autosetupmerge true</strong></p>

<p>tells git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so
that git-pull(1) will appropriately merge from that remote
branch.&nbsp; Recommended. Without this, you will have to add
--track to your branch command or manually merge remote tracking
branches with "fetch" and then "merge".</p>

<p><strong>git config core.autocrlf true</strong></p>

<p>This setting tells git to convert the newlines to the system's
standard when checking out files, and to LF newlines when
committing in</p>

<p>git config --list</p>

<p>To view all options</p>

<p><strong>git config apply.whitespace nowarn</strong></p>

<p>To ignore whitespace</p>

<p>N.B - You can add "--global" after "git config" to any of
these commands to make it apply to all git repos (writes to
~/.gitconfig).</p>

<h4>Info</h4>

<p><strong>git reflog</strong></p>

<p>Use this to recover from <em>major</em> mess ups! It's
basically a log of the last few actions and you might have luck
and find old commits that have been lost by doing a complex
merge.</p>

<p><strong>git diff</strong></p>

<p>show a diff of the changes made since your last commit to diff
one file: "git diff -- filename". To show a diff between staging
area and HEAD:</p>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
    git diff --cached
 
</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>git status</strong></p>

<p>show files added to the staging area, files with changes, and
untracked files</p>

<p><strong>git log</strong></p>

<p>show recent commits, most recent on top. Useful options:</p>

<ul>
<li>--color with color</li>

<li>--graph with an ASCII-art commit graph on the left</li>

<li>--decorate with branch and tag names on appropriate
commits</li>

<li>--stat with stats (files changed, insertions, and
deletions)</li>

<li>-p with full diffs</li>

<li>--author=foo only by a certain author</li>

<li>--after="MMM DD YYYY" ex. ("Jun 20 2008") only commits after
a certain date</li>

<li>--before="MMM DD YYYY" only commits that occur before a
certain date</li>

<li>--merge only the commits involved in the current merge
conflicts</li>
</ul>

<p>git log ..</p>

<p>show commits between the specified range. Useful for seeing
changes from remotes:</p>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
    git log HEAD..origin/master
 
</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>git show</strong></p>

<p>show the changeset (diff) of a commit specified by , which can
be any SHA1 commit ID, branch name, or tag (shows the last commit
(HEAD) by default)</p>

<p><strong>git show --name-only</strong></p>

<p>show only the names of the files that changed, no diff
information.</p>

<p><strong>git blame</strong></p>

<p>show who authored each line/p&gt;</p>

<p><strong>git blame</strong></p>

<p>show who authored each line in as of (allows blame to go back
in time)</p>

<p><strong>git gui blame</strong></p>

<p>really nice GUI interface to git blame</p>

<p><strong>git whatchanged</strong></p>

<p>show only the commits which affected listing the most recent
first view all changes made to a file on a branch:</p>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
      git whatchanged &lt;branch&gt; &lt;file&gt;  | grep commit | colrm 1 7 | xargs -I % git show % &lt;file&gt;
 
</pre>
</div>

<p>this could be combined with git remote show to find all
changes on all branches to aparticular file.</p>

<p><strong>git diff head path/to/fubar</strong></p>

<p>show the diff between a file on the current branch and
potentially another branch</p>

<p><strong>git diff --cached []</strong></p>

<p>shows diff for staged (git-add'ed) files (which includes
uncommitted git cherry-pick'ed files)</p>

<p><strong>git ls-files</strong></p>

<p>list all files in the index and under version control.</p>

<p><strong>git ls-remote [HEAD]</strong></p>

<p>show the current version on the remote repo. This can be used
to check whether a local is required by comparing the local head
revision.</p>

<h4>Adding / Deleting</h4>

<p><strong>git add</strong></p>

<p>add , , etc... to the project</p>

<p><strong>git add</strong></p>

<p>add all files under directory to the project, including

<p>Edit $GITDIR/info/exclude. See Environment Variables below for
explanation on $GITDIR.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong>_</p>

<p>Add a file .gitignore to the root of your project. This file
will be checked in. Either way you need to add patterns to
exclude to these files.</p>

<h4>Staging</h4>

<p><strong>git add</strong> <strong>git stage</strong></p>

<p>add changes in , ... to the staging area (to be included in
the next commit</p>

<p><strong>git add -p</strong> <strong>git stage
--patch</strong></p>

<p>interactively walk through the current changes (hunks) in the
working tree, and decide which changes to add to the staging
area.</p>

<p><strong>_ git add -i</strong>_ <em>_ git stage
--interactive</em>_</p>

<p>interactively add files/changes to the staging area. For a
simpler mode (no menu), try</p>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
     git add --patch (above)
   
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Unstaging</h4>

<p><strong>_ git reset HEAD</strong> _</p>

<h4>Branching</h4>

<p><strong>git branch</strong></p>

<p>list all local branches</p>

<p><strong>git branch -r</strong></p>

<p>list all remote branches</p>

<p><strong>git branch -a</strong></p>

<p>list all local and remote branches</p>

<p><strong>git branch</strong></p>

<p>create a new branch named , referencing the same point in
history as the current branch</p>

<p><strong>git branch</strong></p>

<p>create a new branch named , referencing , which may be
specified any way you like, including using a branch name or a
tag name</p>

<p><strong>git push :refs/heads/</strong></p>

<p>create a new remote branch named , referencing on the remote.
Repo is the name of the remote.</p>

<p>git push origin origin:refs/heads/branch-1 git push origin
origin/branch-1:refs/heads/branch-2 git push origin branch-1 ##
shortcut</p>

<p><strong>git branch --track</strong></p>

<p>create a tracking branch. Will push/pull changes to/from
another repository.</p>

<p>git branch --track experimental origin/experimental</p>

<p><strong>git branch --set-upstream (As of Git
1.7.0)</strong></p>

<p>Make an existing branch track a remote branch</p>

<p>git branch --set-upstream foo origin/foo</p>

<p><strong>git branch -d</strong></p>

<p>delete the branch ; if the branch you are deleting points to a
commit which is not reachable from the current branch, this
command will fail with a warning.</p>

<p><strong>delete a remote-tracking branch</strong></p>

<p>git branch -r -d wycats/master</p>

<p><strong>git branch -D</strong></p>

<p>Even if the branch points to a commit not reachable from the
current branch, you may know that that commit is still reachable
from some other branch or tag. In that case it is safe to use
this command to force git to delete the branch.</p>

<p><strong>git checkout</strong></p>

<p>make the current branch , updating the working directory to
reflect the version referenced by</p>

<p><strong>git checkout -b</strong></p>

<p>create a new branch referencing , and check it out.</p>

<p><strong>git push :</strong></p>

<p><strong>removes a branch from a remote repository</strong></p>

<p>git push origin :old<em>branch</em>to<em>be</em>deleted</p>

<p><strong>git co</strong></p>

<p>Checkout a file from another branch and add it to this branch.
file will still need to be added to the git branch, but it's
present.</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>git show :</strong></p>

<p>Show the contents of a file at the specific revision. Note:
path has to below absolute within the repo.</p>

<h4>Merging</h4>

<p><strong>git merge</strong></p>

<p>merge branch into the current branch; this command is
idempotent and can be run as many times as needed to keep the
current branch up-to-date with changes in</p>

<p><strong>git merge --no-commit</strong></p>

<p>merge branch into the current branch, but do not autocommit
the result; allows you to make further tweaks</p>

<p><strong>git merge -s ours</strong></p>

<p>merge branch into the current branch, but drops any changes ,
using the current tree as the new tree</p>

<h4>Cherry-Picking</h4>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
      git cherry-pick [--edit] [-n] [-m parent-number] [-s] [-x]
   
</pre>
</div>

<p>selectively merge a single commit from another local
branch</p>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
 <br />
git cherry-pick 7300a6130d9447e18a931e898b64eefedea19544
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Conflicts</h4>

<p><strong>git mergetool</strong></p>

<p>work through conflicted files by opening them in your
mergetool (opendiff, kdiff3, meld etc.) and choosing left/right
chunks. The merged result is staged for commit.</p>

<p>For binary files or if mergetool won't do, resolve the
conflict(s) manually and then do:</p>

<div class="bash">
<pre>
git add [ ...]
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Sharing</h4>

<p><strong>git fetch</strong></p>

<p>update the remote-tracking branches for (defaults to
"origin"). Does not initiate a merge into the current branch (see
"git pull" below).</p>

<p><strong>git pull</strong></p>

<p>fetch changes from the server, and merge them into the current
branch.</p>

<p>Note: .git/config must have a [branch "some_name"] section for
the current branch, to know which remote-tracking branch to merge
into the current branch. Git 1.5.3 and above adds this
automatically.</p>

<p><strong>git push</strong></p>

<p>update the server with your commits across all branches that
are <em>COMMON</em> between your local copy and the server. Local
branches that were never pushed to the server in the first place
are not shared.</p>

<p><strong>git push origin</strong></p>

<p>update the server with your commits made to since your last
push. This is always <em>required</em> for new branches that you
wish to share. After the first explicit push, "git push" by
itself is sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>git push origin :refs/heads/</strong></p>

<p>Which, in fact, is the same as git push origin but a little
more obvious what is happening.</p>

<p>git push origin
twitter-experiment:refs/heads/twitter-experiment</p>

<h4>Reverting</h4>

<p><strong>git revert</strong></p>

<p>Reverse commit specified by and commit the result. This does
<em>not</em> do the same thing as similarly named commands in
other VCS's such as "svn revert" or "bzr revert", see below</p>

<p><strong>git checkout</strong></p>

<p>re-checkout , overwriting any local changes</p>

<p><strong>_git checkout . _</strong></p>

<p>re-checkout all files, overwriting any local changes. This is
most similar to "svn revert" if you're used to Subversion
commands</p>

<h4>Fix mistakes / Undo</h4>

<p><strong>git reset --hard</strong></p>

<p>Abandon everything since your last commit; this command can be
DANGEROUS. If merging has resulted in conflicts and you'd like to
just forget about the merge, this command will do that.</p>

<p><strong>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD or git reset --hard
origin/master</strong></p>

<p>Undo your most recent <em>successful</em> merge <em>and</em>
any changes that occurred after. Useful for forgetting about the
merge you just did. If there are conflicts (the merge was not
successful), use "git reset --hard" (above) instead.</p>

<p><strong>git reset --soft HEAD^</strong></p>

<p>Forgot something in your last commit? That's easy to fix. Undo
your last commit, but keep the changes in the staging area for
editing.</p>

<p><strong>git commit --amend</strong></p>

<p>Redo previous commit, including changes you've staged in the
meantime. Also used to edit commit message of previous
commit.</p>

<h4>Stashing</h4>

<p><strong>git stash</strong> <strong>git stash save</strong></p>

<p>save your local modifications to a new stash (so you can for
example "git svn rebase" or "git pull")</p>

<p><strong>git stash apply</strong></p>

<p>restore the changes recorded in the stash on top of the
current working tree state</p>

<p><strong>git stash pop</strong></p>

<p>restore the changes from the most recent stash, and remove it
from the stack of stashed changes</p>

<p><strong>git stash list</strong></p>

<p>list all current stashes</p>

<p><strong>git stash show -p</strong></p>

<p>show the contents of a stash - accepts all diff args</p>

<p><strong>git stash drop []</strong></p>

<p>delete the stash</p>

<p><strong>git stash clear</strong></p>

<p>delete all current stashes</p>

<h4>Remotes</h4>

<p><strong>git remote add</strong></p>

<p>adds a remote repository to your git config. Can be then
fetched locally.</p>

<p>git remote add coreteam
git://github.com/wycats/merb-plugins.git git fetch coreteam</p>

<p><strong>git push :refs/heads/</strong></p>

<p>delete a branch in a remote repository</p>

<p><strong>git push :refs/heads/</strong></p>

<p>create a branch on a remote repository</p>

<p>git push origin origin:refs/heads/new<em>feature</em>name</p>

<p><strong>git push +:</strong></p>

<p>replace a branch with think twice before do this</p>

<p>git push origin +master:my_branch</p>

<p><strong>git remote prune</strong></p>

<p>prune deleted remote-tracking branches from "git branch -r"
listing</p>

<p><strong>git remote add -t master -m master origin
git://example.com/git.git/</strong></p>

<p>add a remote and track its master</p>

<p><strong>git remote show</strong></p>

<p>show information about the remote server.</p>

<p><strong>git checkout -b /</strong></p>

<p>Track a remote branch as a local branch.</p>

<p>git checkout -b myfeature origin/myfeature</p>

<p><strong>git fetch</strong></p>

<p>Retrieves all branches from the remote repository. After this
'git branch --track ...' can be used to track a branch from the
new remote.</p>

<h4>Patches</h4>

<p><strong>git format-patch HEAD^</strong></p>

<p>Generate the last commit as a patch that can be applied on
another clone (or branch) using 'git am'. Format patch can also
generate a patch for all commits using 'git format-patch HEAD^
HEAD' All page files will be enumerated with a prefix, e.g. 0001
is the first patch.</p>

<p><strong>git format-patch ^..</strong></p>

<p>Generate a patch for a single commit. Revision does not need
to be fully specified. git format-patch
d8efce43099^..d8efce43099</p>

<p><strong>git am</strong></p>

<p>Applies the patch file generated by format-patch.</p>

<p><strong>git diff --no-prefix &gt; patchfile</strong></p>

<p>Generates a patch file that can be applied using patch:</p>

<p>patch -p0 &lt; patchfile</p>

<p>Useful for sharing changes without generating a git
commit.</p>

<h4>Tags</h4>

<p><strong>git tag -l</strong></p>

<p>Will list all tags defined in the repository.</p>

<p><strong>git co</strong></p>

<p>Will checkout the code for a particular tag. After this you'll
probably want to do: 'git co -b ' to define a branch. Any changes
you now make can be committed to that branch and later
merged.</p>

<h4>Archive</h4>

<p><strong>git archive master | tar -x -C
/somewhere/else</strong></p>

<p>Will export expanded tree as tar archive at given path</p>

<p><strong>git archive master | bzip2 &gt;
source-tree.tar.bz2</strong></p>

<p>Will export archive as bz2</p>

<p><strong>git archive --format zip --output /full/path
master</strong></p>

<p>Will export as zip</p>
