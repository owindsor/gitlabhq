<h1>Update repository details</h1>

<p>This outlines how to update your local repository to use the
new gitlab remote sources. Currently we deal with only the unix
options, but these same commands should be executable from the
git-bash shell in windows.</p>

<h2>For the impatient</h2>

<pre>
cd  example_repo
git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.silverstripe.com.au:example_repo.git
git fetch origin
</pre>

<h2>The longer explanation;</h2>

<p>Each repo has remote sources that you commit your code back
to. These are defined in the configuration of the actual
repository. This means that each persons personal repository
(local copy) may have totally different configuration All
commands need to be run from within your local repository, so
change in to the directory before executing any of the
commands;</p>

<pre>
cd example_repo
</pre>

<p>In the above commands, I assume that you have the SSAU
repository as the Origin remote. You can check what remotes you
have configured within a repository with the following;</p>

<pre>
git remote -v
</pre>

<p>which should output somthing like this;</p>

<pre>
origin  git@cebada.silverstripe.com.au:example_repo.git(fetch)
origin  git@cebada.silverstripe.com.au:example_repo.git (push)
</pre>

<p>You can see that you have two items configured - A Fetch and a
Push URL. For now, We are not worried about the difference, just
that they are the same.</p>

<p>The format of the output is;</p>

<pre>
Remote Name, Remote URL
</pre>

<p>Now that we have that, we can replace the remote definition
with a new URL using the 'remote set-url' option.</p>

<p>First, grab the new URL from the gitlab interface, then plug
in the values;</p>

<pre>
git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.silverstripe.com.au:example_repo.git
</pre>

Once you have configured the remote you can make sure that you
can connect to the repo with a quick fetch

<pre>
git fetch origin
</pre>

<p>All being good, you will either get the latest updates, or you
will be told that your repo is currently in sync.</p>
