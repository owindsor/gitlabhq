<h1>Merging Changes</h1>

<p>This is a quick outline of how to merge changes. This may be
applied to both upstream merge requests and also to and from
feature branches. The primary thing to remember is the direction
that you complete the merge in. In this example, we will merge a
chance from the DEV branch to the MASTER branch;</p>

<h3>For the impatient;</h3>

<pre>
  git fetch origin
  git checkout -b dev origin/dev
  git checkout master
  git merge dev
  git push origin master
</pre>

<h3>The complete explanation</h3>

<p>You have a branch that you have been working on that is called
dev. This is your feature branch that contains a set of changes.
You want to commit it to the master branch so that people are
able to grab it from there and work on it. This is also in
preparation for it being moved in to the production branch once
it has been tested and verified.</p>

<strong>Step 1 - Fetch the origin source to make sure that you
are in sync.</strong>

<pre>
  git fetch origin
</pre>

<strong>Step 2 - Checkout the dev branch, based against
origin/dev</strong>

<pre>
  git checkout -b dev origin/dev
</pre>

<strong>Step 3 - Checkout the Master branch</strong>

<pre>
  git checkout master
</pre>

<strong>Step 4 - Merge the Dev branch in to the currently checked
out master</strong>

<p>The direction in this step is important. You are asking to
include changes from the dev branch in to the master branch. If
you were currently working within the dev branch and you asked to
merge in the master branch, then you would be taking changes FROM
Master, not adding them to it.</p>

<pre>
  git merge dev
</pre>

<strong>Step 5 - Push the changes back up to the remote server,
to the branch Master</strong>

<pre>
  git push origin master
</pre>
